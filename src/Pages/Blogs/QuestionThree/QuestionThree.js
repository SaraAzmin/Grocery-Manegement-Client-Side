            <p>Authorization means to give access to some specific things to a user.For example, if a project is done by you, you only have the authorization of it. It is to give access to certain data or resources to a user. On the other hand, authentication is varifying a user. For example, when you login to your social accounts or even bank accounts, you have your own unique user id, password. The login details you verifies whether it's the right one and then gives access.  </p>
